The counter increments on each clock cycle when the valid_count signal is active and resets to 0 when the reset signal (rst_n) is active.\n\nModule name:  \n    counter_12               \nInput ports:\n    rst_n: Reset signal (active low)\n    clk: Clock signal\n    valid_count: Signal to enable counting\nOutput ports:\n    out: 4-bit output representing the current count value\n\nImplementation:\nIf the reset signal is active (!rst_n), the counter is reset to 0 by assigning the value 4'b0000 to the output register (out). If the valid_count signal is 1, the counter increments. It checks if the current count value (out) is equal to 4'd11 (maximum count value). If it is, the counter wraps around and resets to 0 by assigning the value 4'b0000 to the output register (out). Otherwise, it increments the output register by 1. If the valid_count = 0, the counter will stop, and the output register (out) remains unchanged.\n\nGive me the complete code.\n\n\nEnd of Verilog Description\n\nBased on the provided description, write the complete Verilog code starting with the module declaration given below.

The following is a detailed description of a Verilog module's functionality:\n\nStart of Verilog Description\nPlease act as a professional verilog designer.\n\nImplement a data width conversion circuit that converts 8-bit data input to 16-bit data output. The module provides two output ports: valid_out, which indicates the validity of the output data, and data_out, which represents the converted 16-bit output data. The first arriving 8-bit data should be placed in the higher 8 bits of the 16-bit data output. The valid_out and data_out signals are generated in the next clock cycle after the two data inputs. When there is only one data input, valid_out and data_out are not generated immediately. Instead, they wait for the arrival of the next data input to complete the concatenation of the two data inputs before generating valid_out and data_out. \n\nModule name:  \n    width_8to16   \n\nInput ports:\n    clk: Clock signal used for synchronous operation.\n    rst_n: Active-low reset signal.

The following is a detailed description of a Verilog module's functionality:\n\nStart of Verilog Description\nThe PS/2 mouse protocol sends messages that are three bytes long. However, within a continuous byte stream, it's not obvious where messages start and end. The only indication is that the first byte of each three byte message always has in[3]=1 (but in[3] of the other two bytes may be 1 or 0 depending on data). We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done).

{"prompt": "Assume the role of a professional Verilog RTL designer. The following is a detailed description of a Verilog module's functionality:\n\nStart of Verilog Description\nBuild a gshare branch predictor with 7-bit pc and 7-bit global history, hashed (using xor) into a 7-bit index. This index accesses a 128-entry table of two-bit saturating counters. The branch predictor should contain a 7-bit global branch history register. The branch predictor has two sets of interfaces: One for doing predictions and one for doing training. The prediction interface is used in the processor's Fetch stage to ask the branch predictor for branch direction predictions for the instructions being fetched. Once these branches proceed down the pipeline and are executed, the true outcomes of the branches become known. The branch predictor is then trained using the actual branch direction outcomes. \n// When a branch prediction is requested (predict_valid = 1) for a given pc, the branch predictor produces the predicted branch direction and state of the branch history register used to make the prediction. The branch history register is then updated (at the next positive clock edge) for the predicted branch. \n// When training for a branch is requested (train_valid = 1), the branch predictor is told the pc and branch history register value for the branch that is being trained, as well as the actual branch outcome and whether the branch was a misprediction (needing a pipeline flush). Update the pattern history table (PHT) to train the branch predictor to predict this branch more accurately next time. In addition, if the branch being trained is mispredicted, also recover the branch history register to the state immediately after the mispredicting branch completes execution.\n// If training for a misprediction and a prediction (for a different, younger instruction) occurs in the same cycle, both operations will want to modify the branch history register. When this happens, training takes precedence, because the branch being predicted will be discarded anyway. If training and prediction of the same PHT entry happen at the same time, the prediction sees the PHT state before training because training only modifies the PHT at the next positive clock edge. The following timing diagram shows the timing when training and predicting PHT entry 0 at the same time. The training request at cycle 4 changes the PHT entry state in cycle 5, but the prediction request in cycle 4 outputs the PHT state at cycle 4, without considering the effect of the training request in cycle 4.

These registers are controlled by the clock (clk) and reset (rst_n) signals.\nThe sum values for each pipeline stage are calculated by adding the corresponding input operands and carry signals.\nThe output enable signal (o_en) is updated based on the pipeline stages and synchronized with the clock (clk) and reset (rst_n) signals.\n\nGive me the complete code.\n\nEnd of Verilog Description\n\nBased on the provided description, write the complete Verilog code starting with the module declaration given below. Ensure your code concludes with 'endmodule' and accurately reflect the described functions, including all necessary inputs, outputs, and control logic.

There is also a clock input called clk and a reset input (synchronous, active low) called resetn. The FSM has to work as follows. As long as the reset input is asserted, the FSM stays in a beginning state, called state A. When the reset signal is de-asserted, then after the next clock edge the FSM has to set the output f to 1 for one clock cycle. Then, the FSM has to monitor the x input. When x has produced the values 1, 0, 1 in three successive clock cycles, then g should be set to 1 on the following clock cycle. While maintaining g = 1 the FSM has to monitor the y input. If y has the value 1 within at most two clock cycles, then the FSM should maintain g = 1 permanently (that is, until reset).

{"prompt": "Assume the role of a professional Verilog RTL designer. The following is a detailed description of a Verilog module's functionality:\n\nStart of Verilog Description\nConsider the FSM described by the state diagram shown below:\n\n// A --r1=0,r2=0,r3=0--> A\n// A --r1=1--> B\n// A --r1=0,r2=1--> C\n// A --r1=0,r2=0,r3=0--> D\n// B (g1=1) --r1=1--> B\n// B (g1=1) --r1=0--> A\n// C (g2=1) --r2=1--> C\n// C (g2=1) --r2=0--> A\n\n// Resetn is an active-low synchronous reset that resets into state A. This FSM acts as an arbiter circuit, which controls access to some type of resource by three requesting devices. Each device makes its request for the resource by setting a signal _r[i]_ = 1, where _r[i]_ is either _r[1]_, _r[2]_, or _r[3]_. Each r[i] is an input signal to the FSM, and represents one of the three devices. The FSM stays in state _A_ as long as there are no requests. When one or more request occurs, then the FSM decides which device receives a grant to use the resource and changes to a state that sets that device's _g[i]_ signal to 1. Each _g[i]_ is an output from the FSM. There is a priority system, in that device 1 has a higher priority than device 2, and device 3 has the lowest priority. Hence, for example, device 3 will only receive a grant if it is the only device making a request when the FSM is in state _A_. Once a device, _i_, is given a grant by the FSM, that device continues to receive the grant as long as its request, _r[i]_ = 1.\n\n// Write complete Verilog code that represents this FSM. Use separate always blocks for the state table and the state flip-flops, as done in lectures. Describe the FSM outputs, _g[i]_, using either continuous assignment statement(s) or an always block (at your discretion).
